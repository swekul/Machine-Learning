Customer Fraud Transactions:

What is the problem you want to solve?
Identifying the fraudulent transactions and setting up a system to alert a fraud transaction.
 
Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have done otherwise?
This model will help in detecting fraud or non fraud transactions which will help reduce the fraudulent transactions in future by implementing fraudulent transaction alerts.
perform more in-depth research towards this subject and will look for more efficient ways so that our models are able to detect more accurately both fraud and non-fraud transactions.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
 
 
What data are you using? How will you acquire the data?
Vesta Corporation provided the dataset for this competition. Vesta Corporation is the forerunner in guaranteed e-commerce payment solutions.
Founded in 1995, Vesta pioneered the process of fully guaranteed card-not-present (CNP) payment transactions for the telecommunications industry. 
Since then, Vesta has firmly expanded data science and machine learning capabilities across the globe and solidified its position as the leader in guaranteed ecommerce payments. Today, Vesta guarantees more than $18B in transactions annually.
 
Briefly outline how you’ll solve this problem. Your approach may change later, but this is a good first step to get you thinking about a method and solution.
The first thing we must do is gather a basic sense of our data.
