Statistical Techniques Applied:

Chi-Square Test-
The test is applied when you have two categorical variables from a single population. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables.

T Test
A t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features
T-test has 2 types : 1. one sampled t-test 2. two-sampled t-test.
One-sample T-test with Python
The test will tell us whether means of the sample and the population are different
Two-sample T-test With Python
The Independent Samples t Test or 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different. 
The Independent Samples t Test is a parametric test. This test is also known as: Independent t Test

Correlation:

Anova Test(F-Test)
The t-test works well when dealing with two groups, but sometimes we want to compare more than two groups at the same time.
For example, if we wanted to test whether petal_width age differs based on some categorical variable like species, we have to compare the means of each level or group the variable
One Way F-test(Anova) :-
It tell whether two or more groups are similar or not based on their mean similarity and f-score.
Example : there are 3 different category of iris flowers and their petal width and need to check whether all 3 group are similar or not
